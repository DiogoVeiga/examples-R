# Accessing the GDC endpoints #
The new GDC website went live June 6, 2016. A new feature was the availablity of
endpoint APIs for accessing data programatically. This tutorial will show
how to do that via R, using the httr package. Additionally, we'll compare that
data with what's found in our BigQuery tables.

The GDC endpoint information is found at:

https://gdc-docs.nci.nih.gov/API/Users_Guide/Getting_Started/#api-endpoints

## First let's check that the system is online.
```{r message=FALSE}
b <- "https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status"
content(GET(url=b))
```
